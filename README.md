# stampix-copycat
Stampix web assignment

Requirements

The language buttons on top should update the copy. English should be in there, add at least one other language. We won't be evaluating the translation, of course
The 2 buttons should redirect to, in order:
https://stampix.com
https://business.stampix.com
The webpage should be made responsive. Seeing as the design is not complex, the mobile version can be a vertically stacked variant of the design
Feel free to give your own twist to the page
